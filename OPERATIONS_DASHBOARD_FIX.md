# Operations Dashboard Fix

## Problems Identified

### 1. 404 Errors for Operations API Endpoints
The frontend was making requests to operations API endpoints that were returning 404 errors:
- `/api/operations/dashboard-stats`
- `/api/operations/maintenance-requests`
- `/api/operations/room-assignments`
- `/api/operations/recent-checkins`
- `/api/operations/rooms-overview`

### 2. React Hooks Order Error
The OperationsDashboard component had a React hooks order error:
```
React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by OperationsDashboard. 
This will lead to bugs and errors if not fixed.
```

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing Operations Routes Registration
The operations routes were defined in `routes/operations.js` but were not registered in the main server file (`server.js`).

### 2. Syntax Errors in OperationsDashboard Component
The component had syntax errors that caused hooks to be called in different orders between renders:
- Missing line breaks between function definitions
- Stray `const` keywords
- Missing export statement

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Server Route Registration

#### Added Operations Routes Import
```javascript
// In server.js
const operationsRoutes = require('./routes/operations');
```

#### Registered Operations Routes
```javascript
// In server.js
app.use('/api/operations', operationsRoutes);
```

### 2. Fixed OperationsDashboard Component Syntax

#### Fixed Function Definition Syntax
**Before:**
```javascript
  }, [navigate]);  const
 fetchDashboardStats = async () => {
```

**After:**
```javascript
  }, [navigate]);

  const fetchDashboardStats = async () => {
```

#### Fixed Another Function Definition
**Before:**
```javascript
  };  const
 fetchRoomAssignments = async () => {
```

**After:**
```javascript
  };

  const fetchRoomAssignments = async () => {
```

#### Added Missing Export Statement
```javascript
export default OperationsDashboard;
```

## API Endpoints Now Available

The following operations API endpoints are now properly registered and functional:

### Dashboard Statistics
- **GET** `/api/operations/dashboard-stats`
- Returns maintenance requests count, pending assignments, check-ins, and available rooms

### Maintenance Requests
- **GET** `/api/operations/maintenance-requests?limit=20`
- Returns maintenance requests with pagination
- **PUT** `/api/operations/maintenance-requests/:id/assign`
- Assign maintenance requests to staff

### Room Assignments
- **GET** `/api/operations/room-assignments`
- Returns students without room assignments and available rooms
- **POST** `/api/operations/room-assignments`
- Assign students to rooms

### Recent Check-ins
- **GET** `/api/operations/recent-checkins?days=7&limit=20`
- Returns recent student check-ins

### Rooms Overview
- **GET** `/api/operations/rooms-overview`
- Returns comprehensive rooms overview with statistics

## Authentication & Authorization

All operations endpoints require:
1. **Authentication**: Valid JWT token
2. **Authorization**: User must have one of these roles:
   - `hostel_operations_assistant`
   - `admin`
   - `warden`

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `hostelhaven-b-end/server.js` - Added operations routes registration

### Frontend
- `hostelhaven-f-end/src/components/OperationsDashboard.jsx` - Fixed syntax errors and hooks order

## Testing

After the fixes:
- ✅ All operations API endpoints return 200 instead of 404
- ✅ React hooks order error is resolved
- ✅ OperationsDashboard component renders without errors
- ✅ API calls to operations endpoints work properly
- ✅ Authentication and authorization work correctly

## Benefits

1. **Functional Operations Dashboard**: All API endpoints now work properly
2. **No More React Errors**: Hooks order is consistent between renders
3. **Better User Experience**: Operations staff can access all dashboard features
4. **Proper Error Handling**: API calls now succeed instead of failing with 404
5. **Maintainable Code**: Fixed syntax errors make the code more readable

## Next Steps

The operations dashboard should now work properly. Operations staff can:
- View dashboard statistics
- Manage maintenance requests
- Assign students to rooms
- View recent check-ins
- Monitor room occupancy
