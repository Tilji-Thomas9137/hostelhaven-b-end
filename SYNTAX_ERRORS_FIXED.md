# OperationsDashboard Syntax Errors - All Fixed

## Problem
Multiple syntax errors in OperationsDashboard.jsx were preventing the component from compiling:
- Missing semicolons
- Stray characters
- Malformed function declarations

## Errors Found and Fixed

### 1. Line 225-226 ✅
**Error**: Missing semicolon and stray character
```javascript
// Before (broken)
};  c
onst handleAssignRoom = async (studentId, roomId) => {

// After (fixed)
};

const handleAssignRoom = async (studentId, roomId) => {
```

### 2. Line 431-432 ✅
**Error**: Missing semicolon and stray character
```javascript
// Before (broken)
);  const
 renderMaintenance = () => (

// After (fixed)
);

const renderMaintenance = () => (
```

### 3. Line 512-513 ✅
**Error**: Missing semicolon and stray character
```javascript
// Before (broken)
);  co
nst renderAssignments = () => (

// After (fixed)
);

const renderAssignments = () => (
```

### 4. Line 627-629 ✅
**Error**: Missing semicolon and stray character
```javascript
// Before (broken)
);  cons
t renderRooms = () => (

// After (fixed)
);

const renderRooms = () => (
```

## Root Cause
These errors were likely caused by:
1. Copy-paste operations that introduced stray characters
2. Incomplete edits that left partial text
3. Missing semicolons after function/component returns

## Verification
- ✅ All syntax errors fixed
- ✅ No linting errors remaining
- ✅ Component should now compile successfully
- ✅ All function declarations properly formatted

## Result
The OperationsDashboard component is now:
- ✅ **Syntactically correct**
- ✅ **Ready to compile**
- ✅ **Free of linting errors**
- ✅ **Properly formatted**

The operations dashboard should now load without any compilation errors!
