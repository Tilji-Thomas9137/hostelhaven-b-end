# Email Confirmation Fix

## Problem
Users were getting "Email link is invalid or has expired" error during manual registration.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Inconsistent email confirmation flow between frontend and backend registration
2. Missing proper error handling for expired confirmation links
3. No way for users to resend confirmation emails

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Registration (SignUp.jsx)
- Updated `emailRedirectTo` to use `window.location.origin` instead of hardcoded localhost
- Added better error handling for registration errors
- Improved error messages for specific cases

### 2. AuthCallback Component
- Added specific error handling for "Email link is invalid or has expired"
- Better error messages for different authentication failure scenarios
- Improved user experience with clearer error descriptions

### 3. Login Component
- Added "Resend Confirmation" functionality when users get "Email not confirmed" error
- Added UI elements to allow users to resend confirmation emails
- Better error handling and user feedback

### 4. Backend API (auth.js)
- Added new `/api/auth/resend-confirmation` endpoint
- Allows users to resend confirmation emails for unconfirmed accounts
- Proper validation and error handling

## Supabase Configuration Required

Make sure your Supabase project has the following configured:

1. **Site URL**: Set to your frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`)
2. **Redirect URLs**: Add `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback` to allowed redirect URLs
3. **Email Templates**: Ensure email confirmation templates are properly configured
4. **Email Settings**: Verify SMTP settings are configured for sending emails

## Testing

1. Try registering a new user
2. Check email for confirmation link
3. If link expires, try logging in - you should see "Resend confirmation" option
4. Use the resend functionality to get a new confirmation email
